# GitHub Pages Remote Theme
This is a sample project on how to use a remote theme with GitHub pages. 
This is an unclear design (on purpose) to show the contrast between a [clear one](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card/) vs
a [messy one](https://runzbuzz.github.io/gh-pages2/)

## Remote theme used
We used the remote theme [cover-card](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card) by [epidrome](https://github.com/epidrome). It can be accessed via [this link](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card/) (clear).

## Website (messy)
The sample website can be accessed from [here](https://runzbuzz.github.io/gh-pages2/)
